## Introduction

This Quarto template provides some default settings for a structured report.
It is a proposed starting point with lots of room for customization.


## Headings

You have different levels of headings. `# Heading` is the top-level, followed by `## Second Level` and `### Third Level` sections.

### Sub-heading

This is a level 2 subsection

#### Sub-sub-heading

And this is a level 3 subsubsection.

#### Sub-sub-heading without numbering {.unnumbered}

You can suppress numbering in section headings via `{.unnumbered}`.

## Formatting

In a nutshell, you can use \LaTeX{} commands as well as standard **Markdown**.
We refer to the Quarto and Markdown documentations for formatting details. 

## Figures

### Including figures from files

![A very important plot that shows how different methods perform with increasing simulation budget $N$.](plots/plot_1.png){#fig-exampleplot}

You can reference figures by adding an identifier with the prefix `#fig-` to the figure, and then using the `@`-prefix in the text. Here's a reference to @fig-exampleplot.


### Generating figures directly from code

We can use code blocks (e.g., `R` or `Python`) to create figures and directly output them to the document. Use the code block options (`#|`) to fine-tune the format.

```{r}
#| fig-cap: Charts
#| label: fig-plots
#| fig-subcap:
#|   - "$f(x)=x^3$"
#|   - "$f(x)=\\sin(x)$"
#| layout-ncol: 2

x = seq(-4, 8, length.out=100)

plot(x, x**3, type="l")

plot(x, sin(x), type="l")
```

## Enumerations and itemizations

Here's an *unnumbered list* with structured thoughts:

- with important aspects
- and more
    * and also a nested list
    * with another item
- and back to the first level

Enumerations adhere to Markdown standards, so

1. first argument
2. second thought
3. third remark

creates a numbered list.

## Citations

There is rich history behind the Pythagoras' theorem [@saikia2013pythagoras].

## Equations

You can add \LaTeX{} equations with cross-reference labels,

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2,
$${#eq-my-equation}

where $a,b,c$ in @eq-my-equation are real-valued scalars and the label shall be prefixed with `{#eq-}`.

## Rendering to report and presentation

You can use a single `.qmd` file to generate both your case study report *and* the presentation.

You can use conditional blocks to selectively make content visible in either the report or the presentation. You can find more information [on this Quarto website (Link)](https://posit.co/blog/building-a-reporting-infrastructure-with-quarto/).

```
::: {.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}

<content here.>

:::
```

::: {.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}

This conditional block will not appear in your presentation, but it will show up in your report.

:::

Similarly, you can include blocks **only** in a specified format:

```
::: {.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}

This will only appear in the presentation. 
You can't see it in the rendered PDF. 

This is just the printed source code for illustration.

:::
```

::: {.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}

This will only appear in the presentation. 
You can't see it in the rendered PDF.
